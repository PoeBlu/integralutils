[Indicator]
# Directory paths to your white/benign lists. The Indicator class is

# treats the file names as CRITS indicator type values. That's how it
# knows which whitelist to use when checking to see if an Indicator
# object is whitelisted. I suggest the files in these two directories
# be symlinks (with names of your various CRITS indicator types) to
# your actual whitelist files.
