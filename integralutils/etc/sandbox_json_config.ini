# When used in conjunction with integralutils.SandboxParser, the sections
# in this config file correspond to the names of the sandboxes you have.
#
# The keys within the sections are the sandbox-agnostic names for interesting
# bits of information from the sandbox reports. This way you can refer to them
# in a generic way without caring which sandbox they came from.
#
# Their are a couple different ways to specify the values for the config keys:
#
# 1. A plain string (without any commas) will tell the JsonConfigParser to
#    just assign the value as-is. This includes the samples below that are
#    set to "dynamic". The values are literally set to "dynamic" within
#    SandboxParser, but since we defined a cuckoo_sandbox_url function within
#    the SandboxParser class, for example, that function will be called and
#    the "dynamic" string value will be overwritten with whatever the
#    function returns.
#
# 2. A JSON "path" (that includes commas) will tell the JsonConfigParser
#    where to navigate in your sandbox JSON report in order to find the
#    information it needs. Using Cuckoo's http_requests value as an example,
#    it will parse out report_json["network"]["http"] from the JSON dictionary.
#    Since there is a cuckoo_http_requests function defined in the SandboxParser,
#    the function will then take that raw JSON data and transform it into a
#    "standard" format.
#
# Regardless of the sandbox your report comes from, SandboxParser will
# ensure that instances will contain class variables equal to all of the unique
# key names found inside this config file. For example, even though the wildfire
# section does not contain several of the keys found in the cuckoo/vxstream
# sections, if you use SandboxParser on a Wildfire JSON report, it will
# nonetheless create those missing keys so that you can consistently reference
# them, even if they are set to a blank list or None.
